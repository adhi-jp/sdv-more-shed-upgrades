- Costs, build time, and required materials are configurable. See Configuration below.

## Requirements

- Stardew Valley 1.6+

- [SMAPI]

- [Content Patcher]

## Installation

1. Install [SMAPI] and [Content Patcher] if you haven’t already.

2. Extract this mod into your Stardew Valley `Mods` folder.

   Final folder structure should look like:

   ```text
   📁 Stardew Valley
    └╴📁 Mods
       ├╴📁 [CP] More Shed Upgrades
       │  ├╴📁 assets
       │  ├╴📁 data
       │  ├╴📁 i18n
       │  ├╴📄 content.json
       │  └╴📄 manifest.json
       ├╴📁 ContentPatcher
       └╴📁 ... other mods ...
   ```

3. Launch the game via SMAPI.

> [!TIP]
> For how to install mods or locate the `Mods` folder, see the wiki’s [Mod Install Guide].

## Configuration

On first launch, a `config.json` is generated in the mod folder. For each shed tier you can change build days, build cost, and up to three required materials. If you use [Generic Mod Config Menu], you can edit these in-game.

> [!NOTE]
> Materials use the Qualified Item ID format, e.g., `(O)709`. See:
>
> - Item ID format: https://wiki.stardewvalley.net/Modding:Common_data_field_types#Item_ID
> - Object sprite list: https://wiki.stardewvalley.net/Modding:Objects/Object_sprites

## Localization

Built-in languages and translation status:

| Language | Status |
| -------- | ------ |
| English  | 100%   |
| Japanese | 100%   |

## Using Custom Textures

You can customize the shed textures by placing per-shed textures in this mod’s `assets/Buildings` folder. If no custom textures are provided, the sheds will use the vanilla Big Shed sprites.

Texture filenames and their purpose:

| Filename                     | Purpose                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DeluxeShed.png`             | Exterior texture for Deluxe Shed                                   |
| `DeluxeShed_PaintMask.png`   | Paint mask defining paintable regions for Deluxe Shed (optional)   |
| `GalaxyShed.png`             | Exterior texture for Galaxy Shed                                   |
| `GalaxyShed_PaintMask.png`   | Paint mask defining paintable regions for Galaxy Shed (optional)   |
| `InfinityShed.png`           | Exterior texture for Infinity Shed                                 |
| `InfinityShed_PaintMask.png` | Paint mask defining paintable regions for Infinity Shed (optional) |

> [!NOTE]
> Paint mask files are optional. Include them only if you want to enable the building painting feature for these sheds.

Example placement:

```text
📁 Stardew Valley
 └╴📁 Mods
  ├╴📁 [CP] More Shed Upgrades
  │  ├╴📁 assets
  │  │  └╴📁 Buildings
  │  │     ├╴🖼️ DeluxeShed.png
  │  │     ├╴🖼️ DeluxeShed_PaintMask.png
  │  │     ├╴🖼️ GalaxyShed.png
  │  │     ├╴🖼️ GalaxyShed_PaintMask.png
  │  │     ├╴🖼️ InfinityShed.png
  │  │     └╴🖼️ InfinityShed_PaintMask.png
  │  └╴📄 ... other files and folders ...
  └╴📁 ... other mods ...
```

Quick steps to apply custom textures:

1. Open `Mods/[CP] More Shed Upgrades/assets/Buildings`.
2. Add the texture files matching each shed name (e.g., `DeluxeShed.png`, `GalaxyShed.png`, `InfinityShed.png`).
3. Optional: add the paint mask files (e.g., `DeluxeShed_PaintMask.png`) to enable painting support.

## Limitations with AlternativeTextures

- The sheds added by this mod are not targeted by [AlternativeTextures].
- When you don’t provide custom textures, these sheds fall back to the vanilla Big Shed sprites; however, any textures swapped for the vanilla Big Shed via AlternativeTextures will not apply to these sheds.
- Reason: AlternativeTextures changes textures on a per-building basis, and the sheds added by this mod have different internal building IDs from the vanilla Big Shed.
- At this time, compatibility with AlternativeTextures is not supported.
