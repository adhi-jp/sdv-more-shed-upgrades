Custom Textures – More Shed Upgrades

Place your custom building textures in this folder.

How it works:
- This mod does not include any built‑in shed textures.
- If a required file is missing here, this mod will fall back to the vanilla "Big Shed" texture.
- Only files placed in this folder will be used to customize the sheds.

How to use:
1) Put PNG files here for each shed you want to customize.
2) Filenames must match exactly (spelling and casing):
   - DeluxeShed.png
   - DeluxeShed_PaintMask.png
   - GalaxyShed.png
   - GalaxyShed_PaintMask.png
   - InfinityShed.png
   - InfinityShed_PaintMask.png
3) You can include just some of the files; missing ones will use the vanilla Big Shed texture.
